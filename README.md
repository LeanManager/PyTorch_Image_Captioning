# PyTorch_Image_Captioning
PyTorch Image Captioning CNN-RNN Model.

In this project, we create and train a neural network to automatically generate captions from images.

After using the Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO) dataset to train the network, we test it on novel images!

## The project is structured as a series of sequential Jupyter notebooks:

0_Dataset.ipynb

1_Preliminaries.ipynb

2_Training.ipynb

3_Inference.ipynb

The model.py file contains the CNN-RNN model architecture and methods.

All the information and steps needed to understand this project from beginning to end are contained within the 4 Jupyter notebooks.

## You must have a GPU for this project.
